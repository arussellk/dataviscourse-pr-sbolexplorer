# SBOLExplorer Visualization Project

The Synthetic Biology Open Standard ([SBOL](http://sbolstandard.org/sbol-visual-specification/)) defines a data format that represents synthetic genetic building blocks, which may be combined to create genetic constructs or larger, parent synthetic genetic building blocks. This project, SBOLExplorer, aims to visualize this dataset of synthetic genetic parts as well as the inheritance relationships between them. SBOLExplorer will provide a platform to view and navigate SBOL data to give researchers a deeper understanding of genetic building block relationships, a way to explore the composition of certain genetic parts, and a more efficient discovery of their data.

Our visualization's website includes a usage guide and any relevant information for course staff. 

## Start From Source

All documents (Process Book, Project Proposal, etc) are in the /documents folder. 

I am using `npm` version `5.6.0` which is bunled with `node` version `8.11.2`.

```
$ cd /path/to/this/repo/dataviscourse-pr-sbolexplorer
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The above commands will start a webpack development server.
